The traditional 4-eye check (maker-checker) process, designed to ensure control, is manual and inefficient. It suffers from:
	• Rubber Stamp Effect: Duplication without real scrutiny, creating false comfort.
	• Latency Bottlenecks: Adds 2–6 hours to workflows, slowing operations.
	• Collusive Blind Spots: Vulnerable to human collusion, reducing effectiveness.
These gaps lead to operational delays, increased risk exposure, and inconsistent control effectiveness.
Implement Tri-Netra, an AI-driven agentic framework that:
	• Automates parallel synthetic reviews to validate transactions or workflows.
	• Detects anomalies and escalates them to human reviewers while tracking agent vs. human performance.
	• Provides AI decision and reasoning before human reviewers act.
	• Enables pre-investigative triage for early anomaly detection.
	• Introduces adaptive learning loops based on rejected or reviewed cases.
